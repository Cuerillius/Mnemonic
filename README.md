[Mnemonic](https://paste.photos/) is a website where you can upload images and it makes interactive flashcards out of them.

This tool was made for those moments where you have a folder full of images. \
Instead of printing them, cuting them out and writing someting on the back... \
**You can just upload it to this website.**
